# Equip in Water
It appears that EquipInWater is ready to take the spotlight among mods that enable equipment usage while swimming.
This mod is based on LVH-IT's "UseEquipmentInWater" mod, utilizing the same configuration schema for seamless migration.
Now, let's dive into the exciting details!
The significant change in EquipInWater is its enhanced performance compared to "UseEquipmentInWater." During performance benchmarking, it was discovered that "UseEquipmentInWater" consumed 5.9% of the main loop due to its non-production-ready methods.
In contrast, EquipInWater offers over 50 times better performance while also providing configuration options for water-usable items.

## Thanks!
Special thanks to LVH-IT for their exemplary mod, which served as a valuable reference and inspiration for this project. Their dedication in creating and maintaining such a long-standing mod is truly commendable.
